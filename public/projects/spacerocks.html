    <p>Spacerocks is an Asteroids clone I started with a friend at work.  He's got a thing for Asteroids, and as near as I can remember, he wanted to make an html version because he thought it might naturally lend itself to networked play.  The project got canned when he decided he just didn't like javascript.  I've included it here because it's visually interesting.  The asteroids are, anyway.</p>

    <p>If you spend any time with "Spacerocks" you'll notice the collisions are off.  Physics and collision logic are not my thing.  I salvaged what I could of my friend's code and quickly labeled it "good enough".  The whole of my intent is to publish something that might be fun to play with for a couple seconds.</p>
