    <p>The Birthday API is an API I wrote for keeping track of birthday information.  It's not the first API that I've written, but it is the first that I've written all by myself.  I wrote it in C# using Microsoft's ASP.NET Web API.  The database used for storing the birthday info is SQLite.</p>

    <p>The base url for the API is <a href="http://www.jordanwilcken.com/birthdayapi" target="_blank">www.jordanwilcken.com/birthdayapi</a>.  If you try browse to this location you'll be redirected to the documentation for the API.  The documentation was generated using <a href="http://apidocjs.com/" target="_blank">apiddocjs</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You can look over the source for the project <a href="https://github.com/jordanwilcken/BirthdayAPI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
