    <p>Everyone loves Angularjs, and there's good reason for that - it is a pretty cool technology.  For the purposes of illustrating that I can run with the Angular crowd, I have written an app that I call "Look, Mom!  I can Angularjs!"  You can find the application <a href="http://www.jordanwilcken.com/pedantic-angularjs/look-mom.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  As per usual, I keep track of the source <a href="https://github.com/jordanwilcken/pedantic-angular" target="_blank">on Github</a>.
