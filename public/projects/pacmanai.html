    <p>Years ago when I first started programming I was interested in game development.  My first "real" program was a Tetris clone.  I read on the internet somewhere that cloning Pacman would also be a good exercise, so I tried it, but I just couldn't wrap my head around the whole AI and pathfinding thing.  I moved on.  Some time last year I was trying to think of something creative to work on, and the Pacman idea returned to me.  The thought of refacing a previously impassable challenge was exciting to me, and thus this little app was born.</p>

    <p>You can play with my little "pacmanai" application by going <a href="http://www.jordanwilcken.com/pacmanai" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/jordanwilcken/Exercise13" target="_blank">The source</a> is on github.  The logic that the "ghosts" use to find paths is in public/js/Map.js and public/js/pacmanai.model.ghost.js.  It's pretty simple.  The ghosts are setup to always pursue the shortest course to their ancient rival - the Pacman!  I know that this isn't how the ghosts in the original work.  Nor does it make for a fun or an intersting game.  My intent was only for the ghosts to recognize unique paths and pick the shortest one.  These were the obstacles that prevented my Pacman clone way back when.  Games are fun, but game dev just ain't my bag anymore.  The AI and the pathfinding are all that I'm really after, and so I am officially finished here.</p>
